### Simulation 1: One Mountain

Using only one mountain, with a height of about 2400 meters at its peak, I got the following result.
&nbsp;

##### Temperature T

In this simulation, the temperature is getting higher on the right of the mountain.
&nbsp;

##### Humidity q

The humidity is blocked by the mountain and is higher on the left side.

In this simulation, a mesh of 200x200 and a time step of 0.5s were used.

### Simulation 2: Two Mountains

Using two mountains, with 1900 meters (left mountain) and 2400 meters (right mountain) at their peaks, I got the following results.
&nbsp;

##### Temperature T

The temperature is higher on the right sides of the mountain.

##### Humidity q

The humidity is higher on the left sides of the mountain.

In this simulation, a mesh of 400x400 and a time step of 0.25s were used.

### "Layers" near the mountain

From the videos of the two mountain case, we can see that there are some visible "layers" near the mountain. This actually also happens in the one mountain simulation. To illustrate the idea, I plotted the humidity q result from the 1 mountain case in 3D space. The following video is a rotational view of the plot on humidity.

&nbsp;

From the video, we can see that the first layer (and maybe also the second layer) close to the mountain has very low values. These are the "layers" seen on the contour plots. In the single mountain case, the layers are very thin, and not really visible on the contour plot. But this problem is more pronounced in higher mountain cases and in the cases involving multiple mountains.
