Naming Rules

In this project, the naming conventions follow the Google C++ Style Guide 
(https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), barring a few minor differences due to personal preferences.


1. Variable Names

    - Local Variable Names
        - Local variables names are generally in the snake format: lower-case letters with words separated by 
          underscores (_).
        - Example: int a_local_variable;
        
    - Class Data Members
        - Class data members have names in the snake format, as with local variable names, but with a trailing 
          underscore (_).
        - Example: int a_class_data_member_;

2. Function Names
    - Names of global functions and class methods are in camel format and start with a lower-case letter (Google 
      style guide suggests starting with capital letters).
    - Example: double myExampleFunction() { }
