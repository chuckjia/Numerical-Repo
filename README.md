# Humidity Project

This program has two parts.

* The `HumidityV3` directory contains latest C++ code that performs numerical simulations using the PDE model.

* The `HumidityV3_MATLAB` directory contains latest MATLAB code that generates plots for the simulation results.

* The other directories contains previous versions of computation and graphing code that are no longer in use.

Documentations are provided within the two directories.
